# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists

This flipping cards website could be useful in the context of an online exhibit. It could be an amusing and interactive way for an individual to familiarize themselves with a set of historical figures and their basic characteristics. For example, in an online exhibit on factory workers in the former Yugoslavia, the audience could be introduced to a set of people who were involved in factory life: the card could list their job in the factory, their place of birth, gender and date of birth. By clicking through the flipping cards gallery, the audience could begin to implicitly notice trends and correlations in the historical data that could be explicitly analyzed later, for example the trend that women worked the more menial jobs in the factory. Lastly, the stimulation of clicking through the cards could possibly increase their feeling of exploration and curiosity. 


## Question 2
#### This assignment asks you all to perform a certian amount of work (describing yourselves) in order to improve a project (the course roster website). What responsibilities does the "researcher" (in this case, your teacher) have to the participants (you)? What rights do or should the participants have to the end product? 

I think that the researcher’s responsibilities are: compensation of the participants for their labour (in this case, via a mark); to take care that the participants’ responses are accurately represented as the participants intended; to respect the participants’ privacy; and to ensure that participants are aware of how their data is being used. Conversely, the participants should have the right to withdraw data from the end product; to change their privacy status at a later date; and to understand the data uses, project aims; and lastly have free access to project results. 

## Question 3
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

As I listed earlier, the cards could describe the person’s role in the factory, their place of birth, gender, and date of birth or age. This set of categories certainly has limitations, since it does not explain processes or evolutions, and rather would introduce individuals as sets of categories. This would obscure parts of their life’s story, and identity: for example, a worker might have been an itinerant labourer moving from factory to factory. For such a person, knowing their place of birth and current location of employment does not account for the complex process that led them from the former to the latter. Thus there is a risk of simplifying or petrifying aspects of narratives in this method of data presentation.
